2D Conduction Heat Transfer Solver

This repsoitory includes a number of scripts for creating a 2D Heat Conduction problem and solution in a 2D rectangular grid. Boundary conditions can be chosen for each wall.

The GUI and matrix setup pages are created using Python 3.5 and the TDMA solver utilizes FORTRAN 95. 

Now I'm making changes locally from git.
