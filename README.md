# Conduction Heat Transfer

This repository includes MATLAB and Fortran code that can be used to solve condution heat transfer problems with various boundary conditions. Additionally, the repository provides modules to solve the heat transfer problems in 2D or 3D with a variety of algorithms. Finally, the repository includes test cases with each of the different solution algorithms and a comparison of their strengths and weaknesses.
